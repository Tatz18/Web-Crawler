# Web-Crawler
This is a simple python web Crawler. Here I used ssl(not needed allways) for https connections.
The program search all tr(table row) , td(table data) , span tags from the selected html link.You can make some change and 
make your custom user defiend url. 
# Note
 The program will applicable only if there have table in that url.
